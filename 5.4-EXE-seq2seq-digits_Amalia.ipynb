    "# Seq2Seq - Encoder/Decoder networks\n",
    "In this exercise we'll have a deeper look into the ability to use multiple RNN's to infer and generate sequences of data.\n",
    "Specifically we will implement a Encoder-Decoder RNN based for a simple sequence to sequence translation task.\n",
    "This type of models have shown impressive performance in Neural Machine Translation and Image Caption generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the encoder-decoder structure one RNN (blue) encodes the input into a hidden representation, and a second RNN (red) uses this representation to predict the target values.\n",
    "An essential step is deciding how the encoder and decoder should communicate.\n",
    "In the simplest approach you use the last hidden state of the encoder to initialize the decoder.\n",
    "This is what we will do in this notebook, as shown here:\n",

    "In this exercise we will translate from the words of number (e.g. 'nine') to the actual number (e.g. '9').\n",
    "The input for the Encoder RNN consists of words defining the number, whilst the output of such an encoding serves as input for the Decoder RNN that aims to generate generate a number. \n",
